    <h1>Leg of Lamb</h1>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <p>Trim excess fat and rinse the leg of lamb under running water.

         Preheat the oven to 190C.
        
         Put the lamb into a large roasting tin /Pyrex dish . Using a sharp knife, make cuts in the lamb, about 1.5cm apart, all the way to the bone.
         Rub salt and pepper all over the leg of lamb, donâ€™t skimp on the pepper!
         Lightly crush a head of garlic, not necessary to peel but do remove excess peels.
         Scatter the head of garlic, cloves, allspice, bay leaves around the leg of lamb.
         Top with the sprigs of rosemary.
         Add a cup of water. Cover with foil. Cook in a preheated oven at 190C for 3 â€“ 3 1/2 hours.
         In the meantime prepare your vegetables. Remember you can use any vegetables you like.
         Wash and half, if necessary, 1 kg baby potatoes. Drain excess water. Add the potatoes in a roasting / Pyrex dish. Add salt and crushed black pepper to taste. Drizzle a tablespoon or two olive oil over the potatoes and add a quarter cup of water.  Cover with foil. Pop in the oven an hour before the leg of lamb is done. The potatoes will turn out crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.
         Leg of lamb halfway through the cooking time.
         Peel, de-seed and slice butternut into small pieces. Peel carrots and cut into smaller pieces. Melt 50g unsalted butter and 50ml vegetable oil in a saucepan. When the butter/oil begins to bubble add a a couple of stick cinnamon and the butternut pieces. Brown on each side.
         Add the carrots, toss lightly so that the carrots are coated with the butter/oil mixture. Season to taste (salt and a bit of pepper will do) Cover and allow to steam over low heat until the vegetables are soft but not mushy.
         Roasted potatoes.
         Butternut and carrots, cooked.
         Ready to eat ðŸ™‚</p>
